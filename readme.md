Lab Test Results Analytics & Reporting System: Business Use Cases & SQL Support
Overview
This system enables Labcorp to analyze laboratory test data effectively to drive better patient outcomes, optimize lab operations, and support strategic decisions with data-driven insights.

Use Case 1: Patient Test History and Monitoring
Business Goal:
Provide clinicians and care managers with a comprehensive history of tests conducted for each patient, including results and trends over time.

SQL Support:

The Patient Test History Report query retrieves all test results per patient, ordered by date, helping track patient health trends.

Analytical functions like LAG() enable comparing current and past test results to identify changes or deteriorations.

This supports proactive patient monitoring and timely intervention.

Use Case 2: Operational Efficiency and Lab Performance
Business Goal:
Measure and optimize how efficiently labs process test orders to reduce turnaround time and costs.

SQL Support:

The Average Test Processing Time by Lab Location query calculates average processing times per lab, helping identify bottlenecks or underperforming labs.

Indexing key foreign keys (e.g., LabID in OrderProcessing) and optimizing queries with explain plans ensure timely reporting on operational metrics.

Enables Labcorp to target improvements, allocate resources, and benchmark lab performance.

Use Case 3: Test Volume and Demand Trends
Business Goal:
Understand demand trends across test categories (e.g., blood tests) to optimize inventory, staffing, and scheduling.

SQL Support:

The Test Volume Trends query aggregates the number of tests performed monthly per category.

Time-series grouping and filtering by category assist forecasting demand spikes or seasonal patterns.

Supports operational planning and supply chain management.

Use Case 4: Quality Control: Detecting Abnormal Test Results
Business Goal:
Identify patients with abnormal lab results for further investigation, improving diagnostic accuracy and patient care.

SQL Support:

Tests table includes NormalRangeLow and NormalRangeHigh columns defining normal value ranges.

The query to Identify Tests with Abnormal Results detects results outside these ranges, flagging potential health issues.

Enables quality assurance teams and clinicians to prioritize cases needing urgent attention.

Use Case 5: Management Summary Reporting
Business Goal:
Provide senior management with key performance indicators (KPIs) like total tests, average costs, processing times, and abnormal result counts to drive strategic decisions.

SQL Support:

Views or stored procedures summarize critical metrics monthly.

Use of analytic functions (e.g., ROW_NUMBER(), RANK()) ranks performance and identifies outliers.

Helps management monitor operational health and cost-effectiveness.

Additional Technical Benefits
Performance Tuning:
Use of indexing and query optimization ensures reports run efficiently on large datasets, enabling near real-time insights.

ETL Automation:
PL/SQL procedures simulate ETL processes, ensuring clean, validated data flows from staging to main tables.

Analytical Functions:
Use of LEAD(), LAG(), ROW_NUMBER(), and RANK() provide powerful time-series and ranking analytics critical for clinical and operational insights.

Summary
This system equips Labcorp with a robust data model and advanced SQL reporting tools that drive better clinical outcomes, optimize lab workflows, and support informed strategic management through actionable insights.
